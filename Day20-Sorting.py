Task
Given an array, a, of size n containing distinct elements a[0], a[1],..., a[n -1], sort array a in ascending order using the Bubble Sort algorithm above. Once sorted, print the following lines:

1. Array is sorted in numSwaps swaps
  where numSwaps is the number of swaps that took place.

2. First Element: firstElement
  where firstElement is the first element in the sorted array.

3. Last Element: lastElement
  where lastElement is the last element in the sorted array.

Hint: To complete this challenge, you will need to add a variable that keeps a running tally of all swaps that occur during execution.

Input Format
The first line contains an integer, n, denoting the number of elements in array a.
The second line contains n space-separated integers describing a, where the ith integer is a[i], i belongs to [0, n - 1].

Constraints
2 <= n <= 600
1 <= a[i] <= 2 x 10 6, i belongs to [0, n - 1].

Output Format
There should be lines of output:

Array is sorted in numSwaps swaps
where numSwaps is the number of swaps that took place.

First Element: firstElement
where firstElement is the first element in the sorted array.

Last Element: lastElement
where lastElement is the last element in the sorted array.

Sample Input 0
3
1 2 3
Sample Output 0
Array is sorted in 0 swaps.
First Element: 1
Last Element: 3

Sample Input 1
3
3 2 1
Sample Output 1
Array is sorted in 3 swaps.
First Element: 1
Last Element: 3
